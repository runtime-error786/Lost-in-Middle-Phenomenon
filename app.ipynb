      "The Transformer language model architecture, originally\n",
      "proposed for machine translation, consists of an encoder and\n",

      "the simplest tokenization tool simply chops text into tokens\n",

      "be combined to form a large number of words, including the\n",
      "words unseen in training data or words in different languages.\n",
      "In what follows, we describe three popular tokenizers.\n",
      "1) BytePairEncoding: BytePairEncoding is originally a\n",
      "type of data compression algorithm that uses frequent patterns\n",
      "at byte level to compress the data. By definition, this algorithm\n",
      "mainly tries to keep the frequent words in their original form\n",
      "and break down ones that are not common. This simple\n",
      "paradigm keeps the vocabulary not very large, but also good\n",
      "enough to represent common words at the same time. Also\n",
      "morphological forms of the frequent words can be represented\n",
      "very well if suffix or prefix is also commonly presented in the\n",
      "training data of the algorithm.\n",
      "2) WordPieceEncoding: This algorithm is mainly used for\n",
      "very well-known models such as BERT and Electra. At the\n",
      "beginning of training, the algorithm takes all the alphabet from\n",
      "the training data to make sure that nothing will be left as UNK\n",
      "or unknown from the training dataset. This case happens when\n",
      "the model is given an input that can not be tokenized by the\n",
      "tokenizer. It mostly happens in cases where some characters are\n",
      "not tokenizable by it. Similar to BytePairEncoding, it tries to\n",
      "maximize the likelihood of putting all the tokens in vocabulary\n",
      "based on their frequency.\n",
      "3) SentencePieceEncoding: Although both tokenizers de-\n",
      "scribed before are strong and have many advantages compared\n",
      "to white-space tokenization, they still take assumption of\n",
      "words being always separated by white-space as granted. This\n",
      "assumption is not always true, in fact in some languages, words\n",
      "can be corrupted by many noisy elements such as unwanted\n",
      "spaces or even invented words. SentencePieceEncoding tries\n",
      "to address this issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "D. Positional Encoding\n",
      "1) Absolute Positional Embeddings: (APE) [44] has been\n",
      "used in the original Transformer model to preserve the infor-\n",
      "mation of sequence order. Therefore, the positional information\n",
      "of words is added to the input embeddings at the bottom of\n",
      "both the encoder and decoder stacks. There are various options\n",
      "for positional encodings, either learned or fixed. In the vanilla\n",
      "Transformer, sine and cosine functions are employed for this\n",
      "purpose. The main drawback of using APE in Transformers\n",
      "is the restriction to a certain number of tokens. Additionally,\n",
      "APE fails to account for the relative distances between tokens.\n",
      "2) Relative Positional Embeddings: (RPE) [126] involves\n",
      "extending self-attention to take into account the pairwise links\n",
      "between input elements. RPE is added to the model at two\n",
      "levels: first as an additional component to the keys, and\n",

      "each token in the input text into a corresponding token ID.\n",

      "probabilities using a softmax function. Different decoding\n",

      "are greedy search, beam search, as well as different sample\n",
      "techniques such as top-K, top-P (Nucleus sampling).\n",
      "1) Greedy Search: Greedy search takes the most probable\n",
      "token at each step as the next token in the sequence, discarding\n",
      "all other potential options. As you can imagine, this is a simple\n",
      "approach and can loose a lot of temporal consistency and\n",
      "coherency. It only considers the most probable token at each\n",

      "This property makes it fast, but it also means that it can miss\n",
      "out on better sequences that might have appeared with slightly\n",
      "less probable next tokens.\n",
      "2) Beam Search: Unlike greedy search that only considers\n",
      "the next most probable token, beam search takes into account\n",
      "the N most likely tokens, where N denotes the number of\n",
      "beams. This procedure is repeated until a predefined maxi-\n",

      "appears. At this point, the sequence of tokens (AKA “beam”)\n",
      "with the highest overall score is chosen as the output. For\n",
      "example for beam size of 2 and maximum length of 5,\n",
      "the beam search needs to keep track of 25 = 32 possible\n",
      "sequences. So it is more computationally intensive than greedy\n",
      "search.\n",
      "3) Top-k Sampling: Top-k sampling is a technique that\n",

      "This approach hinges on the understanding that LLMs, while\n",

      "explicit reasoning. CoT addresses this by guiding the model\n",

      "tion retrieval or pattern recognition.\n",
      "CoT prompting manifests in two primary forms:\n",

      "LLM to “think step by step”, prompting it to de-\n",

      "Manual CoT is more effective than zero-shot. However,\n",

      "play.\n",
      "2) Tree of Thought (ToT): The Tree of Thought (ToT)\n",
      "[158] prompting technique is inspired by the concept of\n",
      "considering various alternative solutions or thought processes\n",
      "before converging on the most plausible one. ToT is based\n",
      "on the idea of branching out into multiple ”thought trees”\n",
      "where each branch represents a different line of reasoning.\n",
      "This method allows the LLM to explore various possibilities\n",
      "and hypotheses, much like human cognitive processes where\n",
      "multiple scenarios are considered before determining the most\n",
      "likely one.\n",
      "A critical aspect of ToT is the evaluation of these reasoning\n",
      "paths. As the LLM generates different branches of thought,\n",
      "each is assessed for its validity and relevance to the query.\n",
      "This process involves real-time analysis and comparison of\n",
      "the branches, leading to a selection of the most coherent and\n",
      "logical outcome.\n",
      "ToT is particularly useful in complex problem-solving\n",
      "scenarios where a single line of reasoning might not suffice.\n",

      "a valuable tool in advanced AI applications.\n",
      "3) Self-Consistency:\n",
      "Self-Consistency [159] utilizes an\n",
      "ensemble-based method, where the LLM is prompted to gen-\n",
      "erate multiple responses to the same query. The consistency\n",
      "among these responses serves as an indicator of their accuracy\n",
      "and reliability.\n",
      "The Self-Consistency approach is grounded in the principle\n",
      "that if an LLM generates multiple, similar responses to the\n",
      "same prompt, it is more likely that the response is accurate.\n",
      "This method involves asking the LLM to tackle a query mul-\n",
      "tiple times, each time analyzing the response for consistency.\n",
      "This technique is especially useful in scenarios where factual\n",
      "accuracy and precision are paramount.\n",
      "The consistency of responses can be measured using vari-\n",
      "ous methods. One common approach is to analyze the overlap\n",
      "in the content of the responses. Other methods may include\n",
      "comparing the semantic similarity of responses or employing\n",
      "more sophisticated techniques like BERT-scores or n-gram\n",
      "overlaps. These measures help in quantifying the level of\n",
      "agreement among the responses generated by the LLM.\n",
      "Self-Consistency has significant applications in fields\n",
      "where the veracity of information is critical. It is particularly\n",
      "relevant in scenarios like fact-checking, where ensuring the\n",
      "accuracy of information provided by AI models is essential.\n",
      "By employing this technique, prompt engineers can enhance\n",
      "the trustworthiness of LLMs, making them more reliable for\n",
      "tasks that require high levels of factual accuracy.\n",
      "4) Reflection: Reflection [160] involves prompting LLMs\n",
      "to assess and potentially revise their own outputs based on\n",
      "reasoning about the correctness and coherence of their re-\n",
      "sponses. The concept of Reflection centers on the ability of\n",

      "to the generation of revised or improved responses.\n",
      "A key aspect of Reflection is the LLM’s capacity for\n",

      "how much longer this architecture will be in vogue, and what\n",
      "will be the next big architectural break-through in the field of\n",
      "deep learning (and NLP). Since AlexNet in 2012, we have seen\n",

      "Having a good answer to many prompts requires context.\n",
      "For example, the response to ”Recommend some good movies\n",

      "That being said, new architectures might not only propose\n",

      "stage that increases the supported context window to 128K tokens. See Section 3 for details.\n",

      "At this post-training2 stage, we also integrate new capabilities, such as tool-use, and observe strong\n",
      "improvements in other areas, such as coding and reasoning. See Section 4 for details. Finally, safety\n",
      "mitigations are also incorporated into the model at the post-training stage, the details of which are\n",
      "described in Section 5.4.\n",
      "The resulting models have a rich set of capabilities. They can answer questions in at least eight languages,\n",
      "write high-quality code, solve complex reasoning problems, and use tools out-of-the-box or in a zero-shot way.\n",
      "We also perform experiments in which we add image, video, and speech capabilities to Llama 3 using a\n",
      "compositional approach. The approach we study comprises the three additional stages illustrated in Figure 28:\n",
      "• Multi-modal encoder pre-training. We train separate encoders for images and speech. We train our\n",
      "image encoder on large amounts of image-text pairs. This teaches the model the relation between visual\n",
      "content and the description of that content in natural language. Our speech encoder is trained using a\n",

      "predict the next token of a textual sequence. See text for details.\n",
      "self-supervised approach that masks out parts of the speech inputs and tries to reconstruct the masked\n",
      "out parts via a discrete-token representation. As a result, the model learns the structure of speech\n",
      "signals. See Section 7 for details on the image encoder and Section 8 for details on the speech encoder.\n",
      "• Vision adapter training. We train an adapter that integrates the pre-trained image encoder into the\n",
      "pre-trained language model. The adapter consists of a series of cross-attention layers that feed image-\n",
      "encoder representations into the language model. The adapter is trained on text-image pairs. This\n",
      "aligns the image representations with the language representations. During adapter training, we also\n",
      "update the parameters of the image encoder but we intentionally do not update the language-model\n",
      "parameters. We also train a video adapter on top of the image adapter on paired video-text data. This\n",
      "enables the model to aggregate information across frames. See Section 7 for details.\n",
      "• Speech adapter training. Finally, we integrate the speech encoder into the model via an adapter that\n",
      "converts speech encodings into token representations that can be fed directly into the finetuned language\n",
      "model. The parameters of the adapter and encoder are jointly updated in a supervised finetuning stage\n",
      "to enable high-quality speech understanding. We do not change the language model during speech\n",
      "adapter training. We also integrate a text-to-speech system. See Section 8 for details.\n",
      "Our multimodal experiments lead to models that can recognize the content of images and videos, and support\n",
      "interaction via a speech interface. These models are still under development and not yet ready for release.\n",
      "3\n",
      "Pre-Training\n",
      "Language model pre-training involves: (1) the curation and filtering of a large-scale training corpus, (2) the\n",
      "development of a model architecture and corresponding scaling laws for determining model size, (3) the\n",
      "development of techniques for efficient pre-training at large scale, and (4) the development of a pre-training\n",
      "recipe. We present each of these components separately below.\n",
      "3.1\n",
      "Pre-Training Data\n",
      "We create our dataset for language model pre-training from a variety of data sources containing knowledge\n",
      "until the end of 2023. We apply several de-duplication methods and data cleaning mechanisms on each data\n",
      "source to obtain high-quality tokens. We remove domains that contain large amounts of personally identifiable\n",
      "information (PII), and domains with known adult content.\n",
      "3.1.1\n",
      "Web Data Curation\n",
      "Much of the data we utilize is obtained from the web and we describe our cleaning process below.\n",
      "PII and safety filtering. Among other mitigations, we implement filters designed to remove data from websites\n",
      "are likely to contain unsafe content or high volumes of PII, domains that have been ranked as harmful\n",
      "according to a variety of Meta safety standards, and domains that are known to contain adult content.\n",
      "4\n",
      "\n",
      "Text extraction and cleaning. We process the raw HTML content for non-truncated web documents to extract\n",
      "high-quality diverse text. To do so, we build a custom parser that extracts the HTML content and optimizes\n",
      "for precision in boilerplate removal and content recall. We evaluate our parser’s quality in human evaluations,\n",
      "comparing it with popular third-party HTML parsers that optimize for article-like content, and found it\n",
      "to perform favorably. We carefully process HTML pages with mathematics and code content to preserve\n",
      "the structure of that content. We maintain the image alt attribute text since mathematical content is often\n",
      "represented as pre-rendered images where the math is also provided in the alt attribute. We experimentally\n",
      "evaluate different cleaning configurations. We find markdown is harmful to the performance of a model that\n",
      "is primarily trained on web data compared to plain text, so we remove all markdown markers.\n",
      "De-duplication. We apply several rounds of de-duplication at the URL, document, and line level:\n",
      "• URL-level de-duplication. We perform URL-level de-duplication across the entire dataset. We keep the\n",
      "most recent version for pages corresponding to each URL.\n",
      "• Document-level de-duplication. We perform global MinHash (Broder, 1997) de-duplication across the\n",
      "entire dataset to remove near duplicate documents.\n",
      "• Line-level de-duplication. We perform aggressive line-level de-duplication similar to ccNet (Wenzek\n",
      "et al., 2019). We remove lines that appeared more than 6 times in each bucket of 30M documents.\n",
      "Although our manual qualitative analysis showed that the line-level de-duplication removes not only\n",
      "leftover boilerplate from various websites such as navigation menus, cookie warnings, but also frequent\n",
      "high-quality text, our empirical evaluations showed strong improvements.\n",
      "Heuristic filtering. We develop heuristics to remove additional low-quality documents, outliers, and documents\n",
      "with excessive repetitions. Some examples of heuristics include:\n",
      "• We use duplicated n-gram coverage ratio (Rae et al., 2021) to remove lines that consist of repeated\n",
      "content such as logging or error messages. Those lines could be very long and unique, hence cannot be\n",
      "filtered by line-dedup.\n",
      "• We use “dirty word” counting (Raffel et al., 2020) to filter out adult websites that are not covered by\n",
      "domain block lists.\n",
      "• We use a token-distribution Kullback-Leibler divergence to filter out documents containing excessive\n",
      "numbers of outlier tokens compared to the training corpus distribution.\n",
      "Model-based quality filtering. Further, we experiment with applying various model-based quality classifiers\n",
      "to sub-select high-quality tokens. These include using fast classifiers such as fasttext (Joulin et al., 2017)\n",
      "trained to recognize if a given text would be referenced by Wikipedia (Touvron et al., 2023a), as well as more\n",
      "compute-intensive Roberta-based classifiers (Liu et al., 2019a) trained on Llama 2 predictions. To train a\n",
      "quality classifier based on Llama 2, we create a training set of cleaned web documents, describe the quality\n",
      "requirements, and instruct Llama 2’s chat model to determine if the documents meets these requirements. We\n",
      "use DistilRoberta (Sanh et al., 2019) to generate quality scores for each document for efficiency reasons. We\n",
      "experimentally evaluate the efficacy of various quality filtering configurations.\n",
      "Code and reasoning data. Similar to DeepSeek-AI et al. (2024), we build domain-specific pipelines that extract\n",
      "code and math-relevant web pages. Specifically, both the code and reasoning classifiers are DistilRoberta\n",
      "models trained on web data annotated by Llama 2. Unlike the general quality classifier mentioned above, we\n",
      "conduct prompt tuning to target web pages containing math deduction, reasoning in STEM areas and code\n",
      "interleaved with natural language. Since the token distribution of code and math is substantially different\n",
      "than that of natural language, these pipelines implement domain-specific HTML extraction, customized text\n",
      "features and heuristics for filtering.\n",
      "Multilingual data. Similar to our processing pipelines for English described above, we implement filters to\n",
      "remove data from websites that are likely to contain PII or unsafe content. Our multilingual text processing\n",
      "pipeline has several unique features:\n",
      "• We use a fasttext-based language identification model to categorize documents into 176 languages.\n",
      "• We perform document-level and line-level de-duplication within data for each language.\n",
      "5\n",
      "\n",
      "• We apply language-specific heuristics and model-based filters to remove low-quality documents.\n",
      "In addition, we perform quality ranking of multilingual documents using a multilingual Llama 2-based classifier\n",
      "to ensure that high-quality content is prioritized. We determine the amount of multilingual tokens used in\n",
      "pre-training experimentally, balancing model performance on English and multilingual benchmarks.\n",
      "3.1.2\n",
      "Determining the Data Mix\n",
      "To obtain a high-quality language model, it is essential to carefully determine the proportion of different data\n",
      "sources in the pre-training data mix. Our main tools in determining this data mix are knowledge classification\n",
      "and scaling law experiments.\n",
      "Knowledge classification. We develop a classifier to categorize the types of information contained in our web\n",
      "data to more effectively determine a data mix. We use this classifier to downsample data categories that are\n",
      "over-represented on the web, for example, arts and entertainment.\n",
      "Scaling laws for data mix. To determine the best data mix, we perform scaling law experiments in which we\n",
      "train several small models on a data mix and use that to predict the performance of a large model on that mix\n",
      "(see Section 3.2.1). We repeat this process multiple times for different data mixes to select a new data mix\n",
      "candidate. Subsequently, we train a larger model on this candidate data mix and evaluate the performance of\n",
      "that model on several key benchmarks.\n",
      "Data mix summary. Our final data mix contains roughly 50% of tokens corresponding to general knowledge,\n",
      "25% of mathematical and reasoning tokens, 17% code tokens, and 8% multilingual tokens.\n",
      "3.1.3\n",
      "Annealing Data\n",
      "Empirically, we find that annealing (see Section 3.4.3) on small amounts of high-quality code and mathematical\n",
      "data can boost the performance of pre-trained models on key benchmarks. Akin to Li et al. (2024b), we\n",
      "perform annealing with a data mix that upsamples high-quality data in select domains. We do not include\n",
      "any training sets from commonly used benchmarks in our annealing data. This enables us to assess the true\n",
      "few-shot learning capabilities and out-of-domain generalization of Llama 3.\n",
      "Following OpenAI (2023a), we evaluate the efficacy of annealing on the GSM8k (Cobbe et al., 2021) and\n",
      "MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b) training sets in annealing. We find that annealing improved the performance\n",
      "of a pre-trained Llama 3 8B model on the GSM8k and MATH validation sets by 24.0% and 6.4%, respectively.\n",
      "However, the improvements on the 405B model are negligible, suggesting that our flagship model has strong\n",
      "in-context learning and reasoning capabilities and does not require specific in-domain training samples to\n",
      "obtain strong performance.\n",
      "Using annealing to assess data quality. Similar to Blakeney et al. (2024), we find that annealing enables us to\n",
      "judge the value of small domain-specific datasets. We measure the value of such datasets by annealing the\n",
      "learning rate of a 50% trained Llama 3 8B model linearly to 0 on 40B tokens. In those experiments, we assign\n",
      "30% weight to the new dataset and the remaining 70% weight to the default data mix. Using annealing to\n",
      "evaluate new data sources is more efficient than performing scaling law experiments for every small dataset.\n",
      "3.2\n",
      "Model Architecture\n",
      "Llama 3 uses a standard, dense Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). It does not deviate significantly\n",
      "from Llama and Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023a,b) in terms of model architecture; our performance gains are\n",
      "primarily driven by improvements in data quality and diversity as well as by increased training scale.\n",
      "We make a few small modifications compared to Llama 2:\n",
      "• We use grouped query attention (GQA; Ainslie et al. (2023)) with 8 key-value heads to improve inference\n",
      "speed and to reduce the size of key-value caches during decoding.\n",
      "• We use an attention mask that prevents self-attention between different documents within the same\n",
      "sequence. We find that this change had limited impact during in standard pre-training, but find it to be\n",
      "important in continued pre-training on very long sequences.\n",

      "result of higher mid-day temperatures impacting GPU dynamic voltage and frequency scaling.\n",
      "During training, tens of thousands of GPUs may increase or decrease power consumption at the same time,\n",
      "for example, due to all GPUs waiting for checkpointing or collective communications to finish, or the startup\n",
      "or shutdown of the entire training job. When this happens, it can result in instant fluctuations of power\n",
      "consumption across the data center on the order of tens of megawatts, stretching the limits of the power grid.\n",

      "Initial Pre-Training\n",
      "We pre-train Llama 3 405B using AdamW with a peak learning rate of 8 × 10−5 , a linear warm up of 8,000\n",
      "steps, and a cosine learning rate schedule decaying to 8 × 10−7 over 1,200,000 steps. We use a lower batch size\n",
      "early in training to improve training stability, and increase it subsequently to improve efficiency. Specifically,\n",
      "we use an initial batch size of 4M tokens and sequences of length 4,096, and double these values to a batch\n",
      "size of 8M sequences of 8,192 tokens after pre-training 252M tokens. We double the batch size again to 16M\n",
      "after pre-training on 2.87T tokens. We found this training recipe to be very stable: we observed few loss\n",
      "spikes and did not require interventions to correct for model training divergence.\n",
      "Adjusting the data mix. We made a several adjustments to the pre-training data mix during training to improve\n",

      "pre-training data that were later identified as being lower quality.\n",
      "3.4.2\n",
      "Long Context Pre-Training\n",
      "In the final stages of pre-training, we train on long sequences to support context windows of up to 128K tokens.\n",
      "We do not train on long sequences earlier because the compute in self-attention layers grows quadratically in\n",
      "the sequence length. We increase the supported context length in increments, pre-training until the model has\n",
      "successfully adapted to the increased context length. We assess successful adaptation by measuring whether (1)\n",
      "model performance on short-context evaluations has recovered completely and (2) the model perfectly solves\n",
      "“needle in a haystack” tasks up to that length. In Llama 3 405B pre-training, we increased context length\n",
      "gradually in six stages, starting from the original 8K context window and ending in the final 128K context\n",

      "Annealing\n",
      "During pre-training on the final 40M tokens, we linearly annealed the learning rate to 0, maintaining a context\n",
      "length of 128K tokens. During this annealing phase, we also adjusted the data mix to upsample data sources\n",

      "in Figure 7. Unless otherwise noted, our modeling procedure applies to Llama 3 405B, and we refer to\n",
      "Llama 3 405B as Llama 3 for simplicity.\n",
      "4.1.1\n",
      "Chat Dialog Format\n",
      "To tune LLMs for human-AI interaction, we need to define a chat dialog protocol for the model to understand\n",

      "multi-message chat protocol which uses various special header and termination tokens. The header tokens\n",
      "are used to indicate the source and destination of each message in a conversation. Similarly, the termination\n",
      "tokens indicate when it is the time to alternate between human and AI to speak.\n",
      "4.1.2\n",
      "Reward Modeling\n",
      "We train a reward model (RM) covering different capabilities on top of the pre-trained checkpoint. The\n",

      "diminishing improvements after data scaling. Following Llama 2, we use all of our preference data for reward\n",
      "modeling after filtering out samples with similar responses. In addition to standard preference pair of (chosen,\n",
      "rejected) response, annotations also create a third “edited response” for some prompts, where the chosen\n",
      "response from the pair is further edited for improvement (see Section 4.2.1). Hence, each preference ranking\n",
      "sample has two or three responses with clear ranking (edited > chosen > rejected). We concatenate the\n",

      "on the target tokens (while masking loss on prompt tokens). More details about the data mix can be found\n",

      "hypothesize that this is due to the contrastive nature of the DPO loss – the presence of common tokens\n",
      "in both chosen and rejected responses leads to a conflicting learning objective as the model needs to\n",
      "increase and reduce the likelihood of these tokens simultaneously.\n",
      "• Regularization with NLL loss: We add an additional negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss term with a scaling\n",
      "coefficient of 0.2 on the chosen sequences, similar to Pang et al. (2024). This helps further stabilize DPO\n",

      "complementary approach at a lower cost and higher scale, unconstrained by the expertise level of annotators.\n",
      "As such, we use Llama 3 and the code expert to generate a large quantity of synthetic SFT dialogs.\n",

      "1. Synthetic data generation: execution feedback. The 8B and 70B models show significant performance\n",
      "improvements when trained on data generated by a larger, more competent model. However, our initial\n",
      "experiments revealed that training Llama 3 405B on its own generated data is not helpful (and can\n",
      "even degrade performance). To address this limitation, we introduced execution feedback as a source of\n",
      "truth, enabling the model to learn from its mistakes and stay on track. In particular, we generate large\n",
      "dataset of approximately one million synthetic coding dialogues using the following process:\n",
      "• Problem description generation: First, we generate a large collection of programming problem\n",
      "descriptions that span a diverse range of topics, including those in the long tail distribution. To\n",
      "achieve this diversity, we sample random code snippets from various sources and prompt the model\n",
      "to generate programming problems inspired by these examples. This allowed us to tap into a wide\n",
      "range of topics and create a comprehensive set of problem descriptions (Wei et al., 2024).\n",
      "• Solution generation: Then, we prompt Llama 3 to solve each problem in a given programming\n",
      "language. We observe that adding general rules of good programming to the prompt improves the\n",
      "generated solution quality. Also, we find it is helpful to require the model to explain its thought\n",
      "process in comments.\n",
      "• Correctness analysis: After generating a solution, it is crucial to recognize that its correctness is\n",
      "not guaranteed, and including incorrect solutions in the finetuning dataset could harm the model’s\n",
      "quality. While we do not ensure complete correctness, we develop methods to approximate it. To\n",
      "achieve this, we extract the source code from the generated solution and applied a combination of\n",
      "static and dynamic analysis techniques to test its correctness, including:\n",
      "– Static analysis: We run all generated code through a parser and a linter to ensure syntactic\n",
      "correctness, catching errors such as syntax errors, use of uninitialized variables or non-imported\n",
      "functions, code style issues, typing errors, and others.\n",
      "– Unit test generation and execution: For each problem and solution, we prompt the model\n",
      "to generate unit tests, executed in a containerized environment together with the solution,\n",
      "catching run-time execution errors and some semantic errors.\n",
      "• Error feedback and iterative self-correction: When a solution fails at any step, we prompt the\n",
      "model to revise it. The prompt included the original problem description, the faulty solution,\n",
      "and feedback from the parser/linter/tester (stdout, stderr/ and return code). After a unit test\n",
      "execution failure, the model could either fix the code to pass the existing tests or modify its unit\n",
      "tests to accommodate the generated code. Only dialogs that pass all checks are included in the final\n",
      "dataset, used for supervised finetuning (SFT). Notably, we observed that about 20% of solutions\n",
      "were initially incorrect but self-corrected, indicating that the model learned from the execution\n",
      "feedback and improved its performance.\n",
      "• Fine-tuning and iterative improvement: The finetuning process is conducted over multiple rounds,\n",
      "with each round building on the previous one. After each round, the model is improved, generating\n",
      "higher-quality synthetic data for the next round. This iterative process allows for progressive\n",
      "refinement and enhancement of the model’s performance.\n",
      "2. Synthetic data generation: programming language translation. We observe a performance gap between\n",
      "major programming languages (e.g., Python/C++) and less common ones (e.g., Typescript/PHP). This\n",
      "is not surprising as we have less training data for less common programming languages. To mitigate\n",
      "this, we supplement our existing data by translating data from common programming languages to\n",
      "less common languages (similar to Chen et al. (2023) in the context of reasoning). This is achieved\n",

      "data, and 34.6% translated reasoning data.\n",
      "• Human annotations: We collect high-quality, manually annotated data from linguists and native speakers.\n",
      "These annotations mostly consist of open-ended prompts that represent real world use cases.\n",
      "• Data from other NLP tasks: To further augment, we use multilingual training data from other tasks\n",
      "and rewrite into dialog format. For example, we use data from exams-qa (Hardalov et al., 2020)\n",
      "and Conic10k (Wu et al., 2023). To improve language alignment, we also use parallel texts from\n",
      "GlobalVoices (Prokopidis et al., 2016) and Wikimedia (Tiedemann, 2012). We use LID based filtering\n",
      "and Blaser2.0 (Seamless Communication et al., 2023) to remove low quality data. For parallel text data,\n",
      "instead of using the bitext pairs directly, we apply a multilingual template inspired by Wei et al. (2022a)\n",
      "to better simulate real-life conversations in translation and language learning scenarios.\n",
      "• Rejection sampled data: We apply rejection sampling on our human annotated prompts to generate\n",
      "high-quality samples for finetuning, with few modifications compared to the process for English data:\n",
      "– Generation: We explored randomly choosing the temperature hyperparameter from the range\n",

      "for multilingual prompts can get creative and inspiring, but are also susceptible to unnecessary\n",
      "or unnatural code-switching. In the final round of post-training, we use a constant value of 0.6\n",
      "to balance the trade-off. Additionally, we used specialized system prompts to improve response\n",
      "format, structure and general readability.\n",

      "ensure high language-match rate between the prompt and response (e.g., a romanized Hindi prompt\n",
      "should not expect a response in Hindi Devanagari script).\n",

      "Math and Reasoning\n",
      "We define reasoning as the ability to perform multi-step computations and arrive at the correct final answer.\n",
      "Several challenges guide our approach to training models that excel in mathematical reasoning:\n",
      "• Lack of prompts: As the complexity of questions increases, the number of valid prompts or questions\n",
      "for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) decreases. This scarcity makes it difficult to create diverse and\n",
      "representative training datasets for teaching models various mathematical skills (Yu et al., 2023; Yue\n",
      "et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023; Mitra et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024; Yue et al., 2024b).\n",
      "• Lack of ground truth chain of thought: Effective reasoning requires a step-by-step solution to facilitate\n",
      "the reasoning process (Wei et al., 2022c). However, there is often a shortage of ground truth chains of\n",
      "thought, which are essential for guiding the model how to break down the problem step-by-step and\n",
      "reach the final answer (Zelikman et al., 2022).\n",
      "• Incorrect intermediate steps: When using model-generated chains of thought, the intermediate steps\n",
      "may not always be correct (Cobbe et al., 2021; Uesato et al., 2022; Lightman et al., 2023; Wang et al.,\n",
      "2023a). This inaccuracy can lead to incorrect final answers and needs to be addressed.\n",
      "• Teaching models to use external tools: Enhancing models to utilize external tools, such as code interpreters,\n",
      "allows them to reason by interleaving code and text (Gao et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2022; Gou et al.,\n",
      "2023). This capability can significantly improve their problem-solving abilities.\n",
      "• Discrepancy between training and inference: There is often a discrepancy between how the model is\n",
      "finetuned during training and how it is used during inference. During inference, the finetuned model may\n",
      "interact with humans or other models, requiring it to improve its reasoning using feedback. Ensuring\n",
      "consistency between training and real-world usage is crucial for maintaining reasoning performance.\n",
      "To address these challenges, we apply the following methodologies:\n",
      "• Addressing the lack of prompts: We source relevant pre-training data from mathematical contexts and\n",
      "converted it into a question-answer format which can then be used for supervised finetuning. Additionally,\n",
      "we identify mathematical skills where the model under-performs and actively sourced prompts from\n",
      "humans to teach models such skills. To facilitate this process, we create a taxonomy of mathematical\n",
      "skills (Didolkar et al., 2024) and ask humans to provide relevant prompts/questions accordingly.\n",
      "• Augmenting training data with step-wise reasoning traces: We use Llama 3 to generate step-by-step\n",
      "solutions for a set of prompts. For each prompt, the model produces a variable number of generations.\n",
      "These generations are then filtered based on the correct answer (Li et al., 2024a). We also do self-\n",
      "verification where Llama 3 is used to verify whether a particular step-by-step solution is valid for a given\n",
      "question. This process improves the quality of the finetuning data by eliminating instances where the\n",
      "model does not produce valid reasoning traces.\n",
      "• Filtering incorrect reasoning traces: We train outcome and stepwise reward models (Lightman et al., 2023;\n",
      "Wang et al., 2023a) to filter training data where the intermediate reasoning steps were incorrect. These\n",
      "reward models are used to eliminate data with invalid step-by-step reasoning, ensuring high-quality\n",
      "data for finetuning. For more challenging prompts, we use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with\n",
      "learned step-wise reward models to generate valid reasoning traces, further enhancing the collection of\n",
      "high-quality reasoning data (Xie et al., 2024).\n",
      "• Interleaving code and text reasoning: We prompt Llama 3 to solve reasoning problems through a\n",
      "combination of textual reasoning and associated Python code (Gou et al., 2023). Code execution is used\n",
      "as a feedback signal to eliminate cases where the reasoning chain was not valid, ensuring the correctness\n",
      "of the reasoning process.\n",
      "• Learning from feedback and mistakes: To simulate human feedback, we utilize incorrect generations (i.e.,\n",
      "generations leading to incorrect reasoning traces) and perform error correction by prompting Llama 3 to\n",
      "23\n",
      "\n",
      "yield correct generations (An et al., 2023b; Welleck et al., 2022; Madaan et al., 2024a). The iterative\n",

      "4.3.4\n",
      "Long Context\n",
      "During the final pre-training stage, we extend the context length of Llama 3 from 8K tokens to 128K tokens\n",
      "(see Section 3.4 for more details). Similar to pre-training, we find that during finetuning we must carefully\n",
      "tune the recipe to balance short and long-context capabilities.\n",
      "SFT and synthetic data generation. Naively applying our existing SFT recipe with only short-context data\n",
      "resulted in significant regressions in long-context capabilities from pre-training, highlighting the need to\n",
      "incorporate long-context data in our SFT data mix. In practice, however, it is largely impractical to get humans\n",
      "to annotate such examples due to the tedious and time-consuming nature of reading lengthy contexts, so we\n",
      "predominantly rely on synthetic data to fill this gap. We use earlier versions of Llama 3 to generate synthetic\n",
      "data based on the key long-context use-cases: (possibly multi-turn) question-answering, summarization for\n",
      "long documents, and reasoning over code repositories, and describe them in greater detail below.\n",
      "• Question answering: We carefully curate a set of long documents from our pre-training mix. We split\n",
      "these documents into chunks of 8K tokens, and prompted an earlier version of the Llama 3 model to\n",
      "generate QA pairs conditional on randomly selected chunks. During training, the whole document is\n",
      "used as context.\n",
      "• Summarization: We applied hierarchical summarization of long-context documents by first summarizing\n",
      "the chunks of 8K input length using our strongest Llama 3 8K context model and then summarizing\n",
      "the summaries. During training we provide the full document and prompt the model to summarize the\n",
      "document while preserving all the important details. We also generate QA pairs based on the summaries\n",
      "of the documents and prompt the model with questions that require global understanding of the whole\n",
      "long document.\n",
      "• Long context code reasoning: We parse Python files to identify import statements and determine their\n",
      "dependencies. From here, we select the most commonly depended-upon files, specifically those referenced\n",
      "by at least five other files. We remove one of these key files from a repository and prompt the model to\n",
      "identify which files depended on the missing file and to generate the necessary missing code.\n",
      "We further categorize these synthetically generated samples based on the sequence length (16K, 32K, 64K\n",
      "and 128K) to enable more fine-grained targeting of input lengths.\n",
      "Through careful ablations, we observe that mixing 0.1% of synthetically generated long-context data with the\n",
      "original short-context data optimizes the performance across both short-context and long-context benchmarks.\n",
      "DPO. We observe that using only short context training data in DPO did not negatively impact long-context\n",
      "performance as long as the SFT model is high quality in long context tasks. We suspect this is due to the\n",
      "fact that our DPO recipe has fewer optimizer steps than SFT. Given this finding, we keep the standard\n",
      "short-context recipe for DPO on top of our long-context SFT checkpoints.\n",
      "4.3.5\n",
      "Tool Use\n",
      "Teaching LLMs to use tools such as search engines or code interpreters hugely expands the range of tasks\n",
      "they can solve, transforming them from pure chat models into more general assistants (Nakano et al., 2021;\n",
      "Thoppilan et al., 2022; Parisi et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023; Mialon et al., 2023a; Schick et al., 2024). We train\n",

      "Implementation. We implement our core tools as Python objects with different methods. Zero-shot tools can\n",
      "be implemented as Python functions with descriptions, documentation (i.e., examples for how to use them),\n",
      "and the model only needs the function’s signature and docstring as context to generate the appropriate call.\n",
      "We also convert function definitions and calls to JSON format, e.g., for web API calls. All tool calls are\n",
      "executed by the Python interpreter, that must be enabled in the Llama 3 system prompt. Core tools can be\n",
      "individually enabled or disabled in the system prompt.\n",
      "Data collection. Different from Schick et al. (2024), we rely on human annotations and preferences to teach\n",
      "Llama 3 to use tools. There are two main differences with the post-training pipeline generally used in Llama 3:\n",
      "• For tools, dialogs often contain more than a single assistant message (e.g., calling the tool and reasoning\n",
      "about the tool output). Thus, we annotate at the message level to collect granular feedback: annotators\n",
      "provide a preference between two assistant messages with the same context or, if both contain major\n",
      "problems, edit one of the messages. The chosen or edited message is then added to the context and the\n",
      "dialog continues. This provides human feedback for both the assistant’s ability of calling the tools and\n",
      "reasoning about the tool outputs. Annotators cannot rank or edit the tool outputs.\n",
      "• We do not perform rejection sampling, as we did not observe gains in our tool benchmarks.\n",
      "To accelerate the annotation process, we start by bootstrapping basic tool use capabilities by finetuning on\n",
      "synthetically generated data from previous Llama 3 checkpoints. Thus, annotators have fewer edits to perform.\n",
      "In a similar spirit, as Llama 3 gradually improves through its development, we progressively complexify our\n",
      "human annotation protocols: we start by single-turn tool use annotations, before moving to tool use in dialogs,\n",
      "and finally annotating for multi-step tool use and data analysis.\n",

      "(i.e., a patch size of 14x14 pixels). As also demonstrated by prior work such as ViP-Llava (Cai et al., 2024),\n",

      "cross-attention layers are applied after every fourth self-attention layer in the core language model. Like the\n",
      "language model itself, the cross-attention layers use generalized query attention (GQA) for increased efficiency.\n",
      "The cross-attention layers introduce substantial numbers of additional trainable parameters into the model:\n",

      "1344 × 336.\n",
      "• Annealing. We continue training the image adapter on ∼500M images from the annealing dataset\n",
      "described above. During annealing, we increase the per-tile image resolution to improve performance on\n",

      "Model Scaling\n",

      "we found a combination of data and tensor parallelization is the most efficient. Model or pipeline parallelism\n",

      "training the adapter for the 405B parameter model. Training at this scale introduces three new challenges in\n",
      "addition to those outlined in Section 3.3: model heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, and numerical instabilities.\n",
      "Model heterogeneity. The model computation is heterogeneous because more computation is performed on\n",
      "some tokens than on others. In particular, image tokens are processed by the image encoder and the cross-\n",
      "attention layers, whereas text tokens are only processed by the language backbone. This heterogeneity leads\n",
      "to bottlenecks in the scheduling of pipeline parallelism. We address this problem by ensuring each pipeline\n",
      "stage contains five layers: namely, four self-attention layers in the language backbone and a cross-attention\n",
      "layer. (Recall that we introduce a cross-attention layer after every fourth self-attention layer.) In addition, we\n",
      "replicate the image encoder on all pipeline stages. Because we train on paired image-text data, this enables us\n",
      "to perform load balancing between the image and text parts of the computation.\n",
      "57\n",
      "\n",
      "Data heterogeneity. The data is heterogeneous because, on average, images have more tokens than the\n",
      "associated text: an image has 2,308 tokens, whereas the associated text contains an average of only 192 tokens.\n",
      "As a result, the computation of cross-attention layers requires more time and memory than the computation\n",
      "of self-attention layers. We address this problem by introducing sequence parallelization in the image encoder,\n",
      "so that each GPU processes roughly the same number of tokens. Because the average text size is relatively\n",
      "short, we also use a substantially larger micro-batch size (8 instead of 1).\n",
      "Numerical instabilities. After the image encoder is added to the model, we find that performing gradient\n",
      "accumulation in bf16 led to numerical instabilities. The most likely explanation for this is that image tokens\n",
      "are introduced into the language backbone via all cross-attention layers. This implies that numerical deviations\n",
      "in the representation of an image token have an outsized impact on the overall computation because the errors\n",
      "are compounded. We address this by performing gradient accumulation in FP32.\n",

      "Image. We initialize from the pre-trained text model and vision encoder weights. The vision encoder is\n",
      "unfrozen, while the text model weights are kept frozen as explained above. First, we train the model using 6B\n",
      "image-text pairs where each image is resized to fit within four tiles of 336 × 336 pixels. We use a global batch\n",
      "size of 16,384 and a cosine learning rate schedule with initial learning rate 10 × 10−4 and a weight decay of\n",
      "0.01. The initial learning rate was determined based on small-scale experiments. However, these findings did\n",
      "not generalize well to very long training schedules and dropped the learning rate a few times during training\n",
      "when the loss values became stagnant. After the base pre-training, we increase the image resolution further\n",
      "and continue training the same weights on the annealing dataset. The optimizer is re-initialized via warm-up\n",
      "to learning rate 2 × 10−5 and again follows a cosine schedule.\n",
      "Video. For video pre-training, we start from the image pre-trained and annealed weights as described above. We\n",

      "freeze all the parameters in the model except the video-specific ones (the aggregator and video cross-attention),\n",
      "and train them on the video pre-training data. We use the same training hyperparameters as the image\n",
      "annealing stage, with small differences in the learning rate. We uniformly sample 16 frames from the full video,\n",
      "and represent each frame using four chunks, each of size of 448 × 448 pixels. We use an aggregation factor of\n",
      "16 in the video aggregator, hence obtaining one effective frame, which the text tokens cross-attend to. We use\n",

      "Supervised Finetuning Data\n",
      "We describe our supervised finetuning (SFT) data for image and video capabilities separately below.\n",
      "Image. We utilize a mix of different datasets for supervised finetuning.\n",
      "• Academic datasets. We convert a highly filtered collection of existing academic datasets to question-\n",
      "answer pairs using templates or via LLM rewriting. The LLM rewriting’s purpose is to augment the\n",
      "data with different instructions and to improve the language quality of answers.\n",
      "• Human annotations. We collect multi-modal conversation data via human annotators for a wide range of\n",
      "tasks (open-ended question-answering, captioning, practical use cases, etc.) and domains (e.g., natural\n",
      "images and structured images). Annotators are provided with images and asked to write conversations.\n",
      "To ensure diversity, we cluster large-scale datasets and sampled images uniformly across different clusters.\n",
      "Further, we acquire additional images for a few specific domains by expanding a seed via k-nearest\n",
      "58\n",
      "\n",
      "neighbors. Annotators are also provided with intermediate checkpoints of existing models to facilitate\n",
      "model-in-the-loop style annotations, so that model generations can be utilized as a starting point by\n",
      "the annotators to then provide additional human edits. This is an iterative process, in which model\n",
      "checkpoints would be regularly updated with better performing versions trained on the latest data. This\n",
      "increases the volume and efficiency of human annotations, while also improving their quality.\n",
      "• Synthetic data.\n",
      "We explore different ways to generate synthetic multi-modal data by using text-\n",
      "representations of images and a text-input LLM. The high-level idea is to utilize the reasoning capa-\n",

      "maintain text-only performance, i.e., we only update the vision encoder and image adapter weights.\n",
      "Our approach to finetune the model is similar to Wortsman et al. (2022). First, we run a hyperparameter\n",
      "sweep using multiple random subsets of data, learning rates and weight decay values. Next, we rank the\n",
      "models based on their performance. Finally, we average the weights of the top-K models to obtain the final\n",
      "model. The value of K is determined by evaluating the averaged models and selecting the instance with\n",
      "highest performance. We observe that the averaged models consistently yield better results compared to the\n",
      "best individual model found via grid search. Further, this strategy reduces sensitivity to hyperparameters.\n",
      "Video. For video SFT, we initialize the video aggregator and cross-attention layers using the pre-trained\n",
      "weights. The rest of the parameters in the model, the image weights and the LLM, are initialized from\n",
      "corresponding models following their finetuning stages. Similar to video pre-training, we then finetune only\n",
      "the video parameters on the video SFT data. For this stage, we increase the video length to 64 frames, and\n",
      "use an aggregation factor of 32 to get two effective frames. The resolution of the chunks is also increased to\n",
      "be consistent with the corresponding image hyperparameters.\n",
      "7.5.3\n",
      "Preference Data\n",
      "We built multimodal pair-wise preference datasets for reward modeling and direct preference optimization.\n",
      "• Human annotations. The human-annotated preference data consists of comparisons between two different\n",
      "model outputs, labeled as “chosen” and “rejected”, with 7-scale ratings. The models used to generate\n",
      "responses are sampled on-the-fly from a pool of the best recent models, each with different characteristics.\n",
      "We update the model pool weekly. Besides preference labels, we also request annotators to provide\n",
      "optional human edits to correct inaccuracies in “chosen” responses because vision tasks have a low\n",
      "tolerance for inaccuracies. Note that human editing is an optional step because there is a trade-off\n",
      "between volume and quality in practice.\n",
      "• Synthetic data. Synthetic preference pairs could also be generated by using text-only LLMs to edit and\n",
      "deliberately introduce errors in the supervised finetuning dataset. We took the conversational data as\n",
      "input, and use an LLM to introduce subtle but meaningful errors (e.g., change objects, change attributes,\n",
      "add mistakes in calculations, etc.). These edited responses are used as negative “rejected” samples and\n",
      "paired with the “chosen” original supervised finetuning data.\n",
      "59\n",
      "\n",
      "• Rejection sampling. Furthermore, to create more on-policy negative samples, we leveraged the iterative\n",
      "process of rejection sampling to collect additional preference data. We discuss our usage of rejection\n",
      "sampling in more detail in the following sections. At a high-level, rejection sampling is used to iteratively\n",
      "sample high-quality generations from a model. Therefore, as a by-product, all generations that are not\n",
      "selected can be used as negative rejected samples and used as additional preference data pairs.\n",
      "7.5.4\n",
      "Reward Modeling\n",
      "We train a vision reward model (RM) on top of the vision SFT model and the language RM. The vision\n",
      "encoder and the cross-attention layers are initialized from the vision SFT model and unfrozen during training,\n",
      "while the self-attention layers are initialized from the language RM and kept frozen. We observe that freezing\n",
      "the language RM part generally leads to better accuracy, especially on tasks that require the RM to judge\n",
      "based on its knowledge or the language quality. We adopt the same training objective as the language RM,\n",
      "but adding a weighted regularization term on the square of the reward logits averaged over the batch, which\n",
      "prevents the reward scores from drifting.\n",
      "The human preference annotations in Section 7.5.3 are used to train the vision RM. We follow the same\n",
      "practice as language preference data (Section 4.2.1) to create two or three pairs with clear ranking (edited\n",
      "> chosen > rejected). In addition, we also synthetically augment the negative responses by perturbing the\n",
      "words or phrases related to the information in the image (such as numbers or visual texts). This encourages\n",
      "the vision RM to ground its judgement based on the actual image content.\n",

      "Direct Preference Optimization\n",

      "Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al. (2023)) using the preference data described in Section 7.5.3. To combat the\n",
      "distribution shift during post-training rounds, we only keep recent batches of human preference annotations\n",
      "while dropping batches that are sufficiently off-policy (e.g., if the base pre-trained model is changed). We find\n",
      "that instead of always freezing the reference model, updating it in an exponential moving average (EMA)\n",
      "fashion every k-steps helps the model learn more from the data, resulting in better performance in human\n",

      "Rejection Sampling\n",
      "Most available question-answer pairs only contain the final answer and lack the chain-of-thought explanation\n",

      "generate the missing explanations for such examples and boost the model’s reasoning capabilities.\n",
      "Given a question-answer pair, we generate multiple answers by sampling the finetuned model with different\n",
      "system prompts or temperature. Next, we compare the generated answers to the ground-truth via heuristics\n",
      "or an LLM judge. Finally, we retrain the model by adding the correct answers back into the finetuning data\n",
      "mix. We find it useful to keep multiple correct answers per question.\n",
      "To ensure we only add high-quality examples back into training, we implemented the following two guardrails.\n",
      "First, we find that some examples contain incorrect explanations, despite the final answer being correct. We\n",
      "observed that this pattern occurs more frequently for questions where only a small fraction of the generated\n",
      "answers is correct. Therefore, we drop answers for questions where the probability of the answer being correct\n",
      "is below a certain threshold. Second, raters prefer some answers over others due to differences in language or\n",
      "style. We use the reward model to select top-K highest-quality answers and add them back into training.\n",

      "Quality Tuning\n",
      "We curate a small but highly selective SFT dataset where all samples have been rewritten and verified either\n",

      "Throughout the development of the Llama 3 model family, we found that a strong focus on high-quality data,\n",
      "scale, and simplicity consistently yielded the best results. In preliminary experiments, we explored more\n",
      "complex model architectures and training recipes but did not find the benefits of such approaches to outweigh\n",
      "the additional complexity they introduce in model development.\n",
      "Developing a flagship foundation model such as Llama 3 involves overcoming a plethora of deep technical\n",
      "problems but also requires clever organizational decisions. For example, to ensure Llama 3 is not accidentally\n",
      "overfitted on commonly used benchmarks, our pre-training data was procured and processed by a separate team\n",
      "that was strongly incentivized to prevent contamination of that pre-training data with external benchmarks.\n",
      "As another example, we ensure that our human evaluations remain trustworthy by allowing only a small set\n",
      "of researchers who do not contribute to model development to perform and access these evaluations. While\n",
      "such organizational decisions are rarely discussed in technical papers, we found them to be pivotal to the\n",
      "successful development of the Llama 3 family of models.\n",
